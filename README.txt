Hi there!
The following project is one I completed for a graduate school class at CUNY Baruch College during the Spring of 2022. 
My professor had us analyze a dataset for a fictional bank that issues housing loans. 

The project has two primary goals: 
1. Who are the bank's clients (in terms of income, education level, family size, etc.)?
2. How many loans are in default? Additionally, run a logistic regression to see which columns best determine whether a client will default.

In terms of how to achieve the goals, I followed three primary steps: 
1. Data cleansing (dropping columns and filling in null data)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (How much does the bank have out in loans? How many loans are in default? Are there outliers in any of the columns?)
3. Logistic Regression (Which of the columns/attributes determine whether a client will default?)

I hope you can learn something from going through my work!

Cheers,
Sam
