This is a project that I completed for my STA9797 (Advanced Data Analysis) class at Baruch College.
I include the R code as well as the report here. In this project, I set out to determine which factors best determine which NBA players would win the Most Improved Player of the Year Award. From my analysis I concluded that of the variables I included, FantasyPTS (a metric used to indicate a player's productivity in fantasy basketball leagues) and DraftPick (the pick at which a player was drafted) were the two that were statistically significant. As stated in my report, the logistic regression model can be improved by adding more players to the dataset.
